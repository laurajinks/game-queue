<br/>

* The user can search for games via the GiantBomb API, and add a game to the database. Once a game is added, the user is returned to the home page with the new game added into the list.

<br/>

* Once a game has been completed, the user can click the "Completed" button to move the game to the Completed page. On the completed page, the viewer can review all previously completed games, add/edit notes, or return the game to the queue if they wish to play the game again.
